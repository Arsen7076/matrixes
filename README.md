* matrix/matrix.hpp : Provides matrix math routines.
    * Main ()
    * Stanal ()
    * Erkuakan (int argument)

## Testing
The tests can be executed as following:
```
make test
```

## Debug
This configuration unlocks all optimization options, includes cooling information, which your programs convey more thoroughly, but slows down the execution process. Debug mode is commonly used in silent settings.
